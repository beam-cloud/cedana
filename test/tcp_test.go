package test

//  Tests defined here are different from benchmarking in that we aren't looking for
// data on performance, and are instead looking for correctness in the checkpoints and restores.

// for this, we create a server and client, connect them to each other and
// checkpoint/restore each of them - validating behavior along the way

// function to validate connections pre checkpoint and post restore
// how to validate "correctness"? should we compare the queues?

// streaming data example
// database connection example
