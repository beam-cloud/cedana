# Cedana 
## Fast and efficient checkpointing client for real-time and distributed systems

Cedana-client leverages CRIU to provide checkpoint and restore functionality for most linux processes. With the addition of Cedana-orchestrator, we can monitor and migrate checkpoints across a predefined network and compute configuration enabling ephemeral and hardware agnostic compute.
